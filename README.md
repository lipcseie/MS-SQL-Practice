# MS-SQL-Practice

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to practicing Microsoft SQL Server operations. It contains scripts for creating and manipulating a sample database named `BookStore`.

## Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
This folder contains scripts for creating, altering, and dropping tables and other database objects. These are commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc. Scripts for creating the `BookStore` database and its tables are located here.

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
This folder contains scripts for manipulating data within the existing schema. These are commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, Sorting and Grouping. Scripts for inserting initial data into the `BookStore` tables are found here.

## Getting Started
To get started with the `BookStore` database:

1. Navigate to the `DDL` folder and run the scripts to set up the database schema.
2. Once the schema is set up, move to the `DML` folder to insert, update, or delete data as needed.
